# > greetings()

👋 I’m **Leslie**  
**Full-Stack AI Engineer · Visual Systems Architect · Vibe Coder**

I design and build systems that live at the intersection of **code, aesthetics, and intelligence**.  
Not just software that works — software that *feels intentional.*

---

## > whoami

I operate across the full stack, translating abstract ideas into production-ready systems.

My work focuses on:
- Rapid prototyping → real deployment
- Human-centered interfaces powered by AI
- Clean architecture with expressive visuals

I don’t chase trends.  
I build tools, interfaces, and systems that endure.
